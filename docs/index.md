# Secure the Nutanix Cloud Platform (NCP)

## The Story
 
Your customer is a global manufacturer that needs to keep operations not just running but running securely, even during disasters. Their industry requires compliance audits for every step of the manufacturing process and all the systems that participate. They must keep sites running around the clock and can't tolerate downtime from ransomware or data breaches. Intellectual property is also a closely guarded secret. 

The [CISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_security_officer) storms in and tells you and the customer's IT director that they're worried about ransomware and data breaches :rage:. They tell you to prepare a full demo showing all the capabilities of Nutanix to secure the environment :sweat:. You've been given a 90-minute session. Of particular concern to the CISO is an email they got from the security operations team talking about [CVE-2021-4034](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-4034) (common vulnerabilities and exposures). They need you to explain what this means, how Nutanix can mitigate it, and satisfy their other security requirements.

## Objectives 

This lab will give you hands-on experience deploying applications that leverage critical security features of the Nutanix Cloud Platform (NCP). At the end of this lab, you will be able to:

 - Understand and demonstrate the security features that can help prevent, detect, and recover from ransomware incidents.
 - Explain the security-specific value of the various components.
 - Illustrate why Nutanix is one of the best-performing and most secure platforms for their data and applications.

## Time

You will have 110 minutes to complete the security lab exercises.
